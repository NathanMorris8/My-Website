# Project Images

Please add the following images to the `public` folder:

1. **autocare-logo.jpg** - The AUTOCARE logo image (car with wrench design)
2. **electronics-setup.jpg** - The electronics setup image (Raspberry Pi with antenna)
3. **trivia-sign.jpg** - The TRIVIA sign image (red rectangular sign with white text)

These images should be placed directly in the `public` folder so they can be accessed at:
- `/autocare-logo.jpg`
- `/electronics-setup.jpg` 
- `/trivia-sign.jpg`

The portfolio is already configured to use these local images instead of external placeholders.
